PiveMind is a personal home assistant project that helps automate workflows inside my workshop, as well as perform general everyday tasks.
It lives on a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B board, and can support a mesh network of boards.

Currently, PiveMind incorporates several ML models which help it achieve intent mapping, text-to-speech, and speech recognition.

PiveMind currently supports:

- Google Calendar <!-- sjkfhskjf -->
- Wikipedia <!-- sjkfhskjf -->
- Youtube <!-- sjkfhskjf -->
- Telling bad jokes <!-- sjkfhskjf -->
- Spotify <!-- sjkfhskjf -->
- Interacts with various machines in my workshop <!-- sjkfhskjf -->
- Blast-gate control for dust collection <!-- sjkfhskjf -->

PiveMind is available both online and offline uses. (Offline modules are limited).

PiveMind makes 0 API calls to the ML models used, and they actually are deployed locally on the board in order to provide as much data privacy as possible for users.

Currently, the PiveMind source code is private and is not available for viewing.
