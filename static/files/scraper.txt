My web scraper project was for a coding competition submission. I spent a total of 4 hours working on it, and then submitted it regardless of the state it was in.

The web scraper uses:
- Vanilla HTML and CSS <!-- sjkfhskjf -->
- Python (Beautiful Soup 4, Flask API)

The scraper was made to collect post IDs, user_names, post_dates, and post_content from a forum board website.

This information is then downloaded as either a .json or .csv file depending on which the user selects.

Everytime a file format selection is made, the scraper re-scrapes the website in order to have the most up-to-date post information available.

Source code for the scraper can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/abristow3/scraper"><u>scraper_github</u></a>
